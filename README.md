# Movie Budget vs Revenue Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between movie production budgets and box office revenues. By analyzing real-world data scraped from the-numbers.com, we perform exploratory data analysis and build a linear regression model to determine whether higher budgets lead to higher revenues.
