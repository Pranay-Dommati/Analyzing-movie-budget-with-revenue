# Movie Budget vs Revenue Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores whether higher movie production budgets correlate with higher box office revenues. Using real-world data scraped from [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets) as of **May 1st, 2018**, we perform data analysis and build a simple regression model to understand the relationship between budget and revenue.
